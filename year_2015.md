Ruby's `String` class is very well-furnished, even without all of Rail's `ActiveSupport` goodness. In that case, just using [`#count()`](https://apidock.com/ruby/String/count) is enough to get us out of trouble quickly.

I am pretty sure there must be an algorithm that doesn't include iterating through the whole string, but so far, the only idea I got would be to use bisecting until I get to the proper index, which just felt like a hassle.
