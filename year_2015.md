Ruby's `String` class is very well-furnished, even without all of Rail's `ActiveSupport` goodness. In that case, just using [`#count()`](https://apidock.com/ruby/String/count) is enough to get us out of trouble quickly.

I am pretty sure there must be an algorithm that doesn't include iterating through the whole string, but so far, the only idea I got would be to use bisecting until I get to the proper index, which just felt like a hassle.

I..am not even sure this one was complicated in any way.

The only thing to be wary of is on line 16: without the call to `#dup`, all of Santa's and Robo-Santa's positions will be overwritten, since Ruby's object model has a tendancy to pass references when you expect to pass values.

Passing by value or reference is a really wonky subject, but this [blog post](https://robertheaton.com/2014/07/22/is-ruby-pass-by-reference-or-pass-by-value/) got nice examples that will get you started.
