# Notes for solving 2016
## Day 01: No Time for a Taxicab

```
Year2015::Day01
  when Part 1
    gives a final result
  when Part 2
    gives a final result
  when Results
    correctly answers part 1
    correctly answers part 2
```

There really is nothing specifically hard here, it's all about knowing when to properly break out of a loop.

## Day 02: Bathroom Security

```
Year2016::Day02
  when Part 1
    gives a final result
  when Part 2
    gives a final result
  when Results
    correctly answers part 1
    correctly answers part 2
```

While reviewing [another code solution for the previous day's exercise](https://github.com/rHermes/adventofcode/blob/master/2016/01/y2016_d01_p02.py), I was intrigued by a very interesting piece of code: the author had treated the turning of left and right into transition paths from one state to another. While the situation felt like overkill to me in that case, it proved to work perfectly for today's exercise.

## Day 03: Squares With Three Sides

```
Year2016::Day03
  when Part 1
    gives a final result
  when Results
    correctly answers part 1
    correctly answers part 2
```

Navigating a matrix of arrays vertically is a bit strange, but nothing we cannot handle.

## Day 04: Security Through Obscurity

```
Year2016::Day04
  when Part 1
    gives a final result
  when Results
    correctly answers part 1
    correctly answers part 2
```

The second part of this exercise involves implementing a [Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher), which is not a hard concept to grasp. It's a bit annoying to work through ASCII values of characters and modulo properly to get the right number.

## Day 05: How About a Nice Game of Chess?

```
Year2016::Day05
  when Part 1
    gives a final result
  when Part 2
    gives a final result
  when Results
    correctly answers part 1
    correctly answers part 2
```

Not gonna lie, brute-forcing [MD5 hashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5) is not something interesting.
