# Notes for solving 2016
## Day 01: No Time for a Taxicab

```
Year2015::Day01
  when Part 1
    gives a final result
  when Part 2
    gives a final result
  when Results
    correctly answers part 1
    correctly answers part 2
```

There really is nothing specifically hard here, it's all about knowing when to properly break out of a loop.

## Day 02: Bathroom Security

```
Year2016::Day02
  when Part 1
    gives a final result
  when Part 2
    gives a final result
  when Results
    correctly answers part 1
    correctly answers part 2
```

While reviewing [another code solution for the previous day's exercise](https://github.com/rHermes/adventofcode/blob/master/2016/01/y2016_d01_p02.py), I was intrigued by a very interesting piece of code: the author had treated the turning of left and right into transition paths from one state to another. While the situation felt like overkill to me in that case, it proved to work perfectly for today's exercise.
