# advent-rb

Consistency is hard without proper goals to set a good (let's dare say "atomic") habit, so I'm writing solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) in Ruby with all the proper required testing.

I'm also adding notes that may be useful if you're learning Ruby.

# How to use
Install [RSpec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-metagem) with `gem install rspec` and run `rspec` in the root directory.
