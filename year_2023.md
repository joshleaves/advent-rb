Part one is solved with [Regexp](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.1/Regexp.html).

* First digit is matched with `/d/`.
* Last digit requires a match and a capture `/.*(\d).*?/`. The whole string is matched, but only the last digit is captured.

Part two requires a bit more work since we also have to match words, but the principle stays the same.

A class `LinePartTwo` has been made to differentiate behavior and have all tests work properly.
