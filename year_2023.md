# Notes for solving 2023
## Day 01

```
Year2023::Day01
  Part 1
    picks up the first digit
    picks up the last digit
    forms a two-digit number
    gives a final result
  Part 2
    picks up the first digit
    picks up the last digit
    forms a two-digit number
    gives a final result
  Results
    correctly answers part 1
    correctly answers part 2
```

Part one is solved with [Regexp](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.1/Regexp.html).

* First digit is matched with `/d/`.
* Last digit requires a match and a capture `/.*(\d).*?/`. The whole string is matched, but only the last digit is captured.

Part two requires a bit more work since we also have to match words, but the principle stays the same.

A class `LinePartTwo` has been made to differentiate behavior and have all tests work properly.

## Day 02

```
Year2023::Day02
  Part 1
    can tell if a line got too many red
    can tell if a line got too many green
    can tell if a line got too many blue
    can tell which lines are valid
    returns the game ID value
    gives a final result
  Part 2
    returns the fewest number of red required
    returns the fewest number of green required
    returns the fewest number of blue required
    returns the cubes power
    gives a final result
  Results
    correctly answers part 1
    correctly answers part 2
```

Again, we are [Regexp](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.1/Regexp.html) in both parts.

For the first one, we have to make sure none of values is higher than the limits, which is pretty straight-forward.

A class `LinePartTwo` has been made to differentiate behavior for part 2.
